                Typically I have a million and one projects going on at once, but luckily I still have time to 
                work on projects for myself. Here's a few of those said projects:

            <h1>Collaboration Projects</h1>
            <p>
                Each year I get to bring all of my bigger projects to life with my friends on Halloween. It is awesome to get to build things
                on a larger scale and show it off to the neighborhood.

            <h1>Commissions</h1>
            <p>
                Sometimes I get commissions to work on different projects for people. Grateful for the opportunity to make different designs
                and get rewarded for doing so.
