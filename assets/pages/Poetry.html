                <h1>*Numb*</h1>
                <h2>By Marley Omens</h2>
                <p>
                    Work in progress.<br> Estimated release date: End of 2024.
                </p>
                <p>
                    *Numb* is a book that is a culmination of years of scribbles, thoughts, and notes that were later integrated
                    into works of poetry. Collecting all the random moments that life has thrown their way, Marley absorbed their
                    experiences and tried to voice their thoughts in the best way they knew how. While it is still a work in progress, 
                    they're very excited to eventually release their first written work.
